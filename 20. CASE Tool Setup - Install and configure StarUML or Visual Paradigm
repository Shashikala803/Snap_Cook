For the design phase of CookSnap – Smart Recipe Recommendation System Using Grocery Images, a Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE)
tool was selected to create and manage system diagrams efficiently.

Selected CASE Tool: StarUML

StarUML was installed and configured on the development system to support UML-based modeling. The tool is used to design various system diagrams 
including use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams.

The CASE tool enables:

Use of standard UML notation

Clear visualization of system design

Easy modification and version control of diagrams

Improved understanding of overall system architecture

The successful installation and configuration of the CASE tool ensures a structured and systematic approach to the design and documentation of the CookSnap system.

1. Purpose

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of CookSnap –
Smart Recipe Recommendation System Using Grocery Images. This document serves as a reference for developers, testers, project managers, and other stakeholders to 
understand the system behavior, features, constraints, and requirements before the development process begins.

2. Scope

CookSnap is designed to assist users in identifying suitable recipes based on the groceries available to them. The system allows users to upload images of groceries,
automatically detect ingredients using image recognition techniques, and recommend appropriate recipes along with preparation steps. The system focuses on simplifying
meal planning, reducing food wastage, and saving user time. CookSnap does not support grocery purchasing, payment processing, or health-related dietary recommendations.

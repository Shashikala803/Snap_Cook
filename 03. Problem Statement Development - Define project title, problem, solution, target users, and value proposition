Project Title:
CookSnap – Smart Recipe Recommendation System Using Grocery Images

Problem Description:
Many individuals, especially students and working professionals, face difficulty in deciding what to cook using the groceries available at home. 
This often results in repeated meals, wastage of food items, and time spent searching for suitable recipes across multiple platforms. Users may have ingredients available but
lack clarity on how to combine them into a proper dish. Additionally, manual searching does not provide personalized or efficient recommendations based on actual available ingredients.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed CookSnap system is an AI-based digital solution designed to recommend recipes using grocery images.
Users can upload a photo of their available groceries, and the system will automatically detect the ingredients using image recognition techniques. 
Based on the identified ingredients, CookSnap suggests relevant recipes along with preparation steps. This system simplifies the cooking decision process,
reduces food wastage, and saves time by providing accurate and instant recipe recommendations.

Target Users:
Home Cooks and Students: To easily decide what to cook using available groceries.
Working Professionals: To save time and plan meals efficiently.
Beginner Cooks: To receive guided recipe suggestions based on available ingredients.

Value Proposition:
CookSnap adds significant value by simplifying meal planning, reducing food wastage, and improving cooking efficiency. 
It provides intelligent, ingredient-based recipe recommendations, ensuring better utilization of available groceries. By replacing manual recipe searches with an 
automated and smart solution, CookSnap enhances user convenience and supports healthier and more organized cooking practices.

A dedicated workspace was created within the CASE tool environment to support collaborative design and an organized project structure for CookSnap –
Smart Recipe Recommendation System Using Grocery Images.

Workspace Setup Includes:

A separate project file created specifically for the CookSnap system design

Organized folders for different UML diagrams such as use case, class, sequence, activity, component, and deployment diagrams

Clear and consistent naming conventions for diagrams, classes, and components

The workspace is structured to allow easy navigation, collaboration, and future updates to system diagrams. This setup supports effective
teamwork and ensures consistency and maintainability across all design artifacts of the CookSnap project.

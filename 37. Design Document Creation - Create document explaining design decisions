Design Document

The design document explains the architectural and design decisions made during the development of CookSnap – Smart Recipe Recommendation System Using Grocery Images. The system is designed using a modular and layered architecture to improve maintainability, clarity, and scalability.

Design Decisions

A modular architecture is used to separate image processing, ingredient detection, recipe recommendation, notification handling, and reporting functionalities.

UML diagrams are used to visually represent the system structure and behavior, supporting better understanding and documentation.

Security is implemented through authentication and controlled access for users and administrators.

A centralized database is used to maintain data consistency, integrity, and efficient data retrieval.

Assumptions

Users access the system through mobile devices or web browsers.

Users have basic familiarity with digital applications.

Internet connectivity is available for image processing and recipe retrieval.

Limitations

The system does not support online grocery purchasing or payment processing.

Personalized dietary, nutritional, or medical recommendations are not provided.

Integration with external food delivery platforms or smart kitchen appliances is not supported.

Scalability Considerations

The system can be extended to support a larger recipe database.

Additional image recognition models can be integrated to improve ingredient detection accuracy.

Notification mechanisms can be expanded to include email or push notifications.

This design ensures that CookSnap meets its functional requirements while remaining simple, reliable, modular, and suitable for academic implementation, with scope for future enhancements.

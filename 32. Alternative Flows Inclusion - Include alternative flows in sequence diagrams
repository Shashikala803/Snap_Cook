Alternative Flows

Alternative flows represent exceptional or error conditions that may occur during normal operation of CookSnap – Smart Recipe Recommendation System
Using Grocery Images and describe how the system handles them gracefully.

Alternative Flow 1: No Matching Recipes Found

If the system is unable to find recipes matching the detected ingredients, it displays a message informing the user that no suitable recipes are available 
and may suggest uploading a different image or adding more ingredients.

Alternative Flow 2: System Unavailability

If the system is temporarily unavailable due to server or network issues, image uploads and recipe requests are not processed, and an appropriate error
notification is shown to the user.

Alternative Flow 3: Ingredient Detection Failure

If the image recognition module fails to detect ingredients due to poor image quality or unsupported items, the system displays an error message and prompts 
the user to upload a clearer image.

Alternative Flow 4: Notification Delivery Failure

If a system notification (such as recipe availability or upload confirmation) cannot be delivered due to technical issues, the system logs the failure and retries 
sending the notification.

Including these alternative flows improves the robustness, reliability, and user experience of the CookSnap system by ensuring proper handling of exceptional scenarios.

Sequence diagrams represent the chronological interaction between actors and system components for specific system operations. 
In CookSnap – Smart Recipe Recommendation System Using Grocery Images, sequence diagrams are used to visualize how users, administrative components, 
and the system interact during recipe recommendation processes.

The following sequence diagrams are created to capture critical system processes:

Grocery Image Upload Process

Ingredient Detection Process

Recipe Recommendation Process

Administrative System Monitoring Process

These sequence diagrams help developers and stakeholders clearly understand the internal workflow, interaction order, and responsibilities 
of each system component within the CookSnap system.

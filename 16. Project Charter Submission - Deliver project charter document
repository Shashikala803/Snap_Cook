Project Title

CookSnap – Smart Recipe Recommendation System Using Grocery Images

Project Overview
CookSnap is a software-based solution aimed at assisting users in deciding what to cook using the groceries available at home.
The system replaces manual recipe searching with an AI-driven approach that uses grocery images to detect ingredients and recommend suitable recipes. 
By leveraging image recognition and intelligent recommendation techniques, CookSnap helps reduce food wastage, save time, and simplify meal planning for users
such as students, working professionals, and home cooks.

Project Objectives
-> The primary objectives of this project are:
-> To help users decide recipes using available groceries
-> To reduce food wastage caused by unused ingredients
-> To minimize time spent searching for suitable recipes
-> To provide accurate and easy-to-follow recipe recommendations
-> To assist beginner cooks with guided cooking suggestions
-> To develop a reliable and user-friendly system using software engineering principles

Project Scope
The scope of this project includes the design and development of CookSnap, which supports:
Uploading grocery images by users
Automatic detection of ingredients using image recognition
Recommendation of suitable recipes based on detected ingredients
Display of recipe details including preparation steps
Basic filtering options (e.g., vegetarian / non-vegetarian)

Administrative monitoring and basic usage reports
The system is strictly limited to recipe recommendation and does not support grocery purchasing, delivery,
or dietary/medical advice.

Stakeholders

The key stakeholders involved in the project include:
End Users (Home Cooks, Students, Working Professionals) – Use the system to get recipe recommendations
Project Team / Developers – Design, develop, and maintain the system
Project Instructor / Evaluator – Reviews and evaluates project progress and quality
Recipe Data Providers – Supply recipe content used by the system
Platform / Hosting Support – Ensure system availability and stability

Project Deliverables

The major deliverables of the project are:
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document
Use Case Diagrams
Class Diagram
Sequence Diagrams
Activity Diagrams
Component Diagram

Final Mini Project Report
Assumptions
Users have access to smartphones or computers with camera support
Users possess basic knowledge of using web or mobile applications
Internet connectivity is available for image processing and recipe retrieval
The system is used only for recipe recommendation purposes

Constraints
The system does not integrate with grocery delivery or payment systems
Health, nutrition, or medical advice is outside the project scope
Accuracy depends on image quality and dataset limitations
Project development is restricted to the academic timeline

Risks
Poor image quality may reduce ingredient detection accuracy
Limited dataset may affect recipe variety
Performance issues due to limited server resources
Constraints on scalability due to academic project limitations

Project Timeline (High-Level)
Requirement Analysis & SRS: Week 1–2
System Design & UML Diagrams: Week 3–4
Documentation & Review: Week 5
Final Submission: Week 6
